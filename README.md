JACOB! 
I needed a recomputable way to redo these hhv6 indexes its too complicated...
Both indexes indexed independently and matched to appropriate sample... 

Mapping using the built in meryl and minnowmap2 implementation for their install
Uhhh I basically went into each directory and did `bash ../index_winnowmap.sh genome.fasta` took like 2 seconds
